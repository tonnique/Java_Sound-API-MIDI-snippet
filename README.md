# Java_Sound-API-MIDI-snippet with light-show

A sample program using Java Sound API (javax.sound.midi package) which shows a frame with a JPanel component in the center of the frame and a button on the bottom of the frame.
When you (a user) press the button, the computer plays randomly generated notes and draws randomly color squares on a panel. It looks like a light show.
